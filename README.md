# My Personal Website

My website was created with a lot of :heart: to share some of the cool data science 
and machine learning projects I've worked on with my amazing collegues and friends.

This website was built using hugo on AWS Cloud9. I've also set it up for continuous delivery 
and deployment - see __Makefile__ and __config.toml__. The website is deployed as a static webpage
on AWS S3.
